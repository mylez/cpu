Description: A description of the different kinds of interrupts.

Software Interrupt:
    - Synchronous (they are like function calls)
    - Why: User space requires some task of the kernel, and it accesses this
    feature through a dedicated type of instruction that initiates the software
    interrupt.
    - When: Initiated as an actual instruction via microcode

Hardware Interrupt:
    - Asynchronous
    - A Hardware Interrupt: External device such as keyboard.
    - Why: The CPU needs to interact with external systems.
    - When: Checked for after the execution of an instruction
    - How: A hardware interrupt is initiated when an external hardware device
    asynchronously sets an IRQ line. The IRQ lines are prioritized

Trap:
    - Synchronous
    - They happen as the result of an instruction being executed, or a timer
    running out (decrementing to zero).
    - Why: Virtual memory system needs to inform kernel of Page Faults (for
    example) before successfully completing a load/store operation. 
    Preemptive Multitasking requires the ability for the kernel to regain
    control of the CPU after a predefined amount of time (after the preemption
    timer register has been decremented all the way to zero).
    - When: Checked for after the execution of an instruction. The control
    unit / microcode can contain information to immediatley halt execution of
    an instruction and save the value of the PC to a Interrupt Address
    register.
